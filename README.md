Web From Scratch
================

This is a demonstration of the very basics of HTTP GET and POST/PUT
via a very simple Java program.

We don't do the networking - this program reads from stdin and writes to
stdout. A very simple shell script hooks it up to a server socket so that
you can see it working in a browser.

For this to work you need the Debian/Ubuntu package `netcat.traditional`.
